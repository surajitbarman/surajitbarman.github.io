</div>

<strong>Dear, Visitor !</strong>
It gives me an immense pleasure to welcome you to my <em>official</em> website and I would like to thank you for taking time to navigate its content. 
<div class="open-menu">(<a href="#welcome-message">Expand</a>)</div>

<div class="toggle-message">

<p>I have decided to put this site together in order to share my teaching philosophy and research work, supervision, publication and other scholarly activities. Here you can find details on my various engagements, information, news and perspectives, whether past or future ones.</p>

<p>I have spent almost 28 years of my life as a teacher nurturing and educating my students to become lifelong learners. I believe our role as educators goes beyond transmitting knowledge– our role is to nurture our students to become lifelong learners– to teach them the skills of <em>how to learn</em> and to teach them <em>the appreciation</em> and <em>the love for knowledge</em>. As Socrates said, <strong>"I cannot teach anybody anything; I can only make them think"</strong>.</p>

<p>I believe that teaching is an exciting adventure in which both the teacher and the students participate and cooperate to achieve a common goal.</p>

<p>To learn more about me, my work, my philosophy and other activities, explore my site.</p>

<p><em>Thank you.</em></p>
