<h1>Dr. Surajit Barman</h1>
</div>
<div class="col-lg-offset-5 col-lg-7 col-md-offset-3 col-md-8 col-sm-12 clearfix text-justify">

<p><em><abbr>Dr.</abbr> Surajit Barman started his teaching career in Barama College, Barama in 1985 and then joined Tihu College, Tihu in 1988. He promoted to <strong>Associate Professor</strong> and continued in Tihu College till 30<sup>th</sup> November, 2014. On 1<sup>st</sup> December, 2014 he joined as <strong>Principal</strong> of North Kamrup College, Baghmara. He received his <strong><abbr>M. Phil.</abbr></strong> from Gauhati University, Guwahati and eventually earned his <strong><abbr>Ph. D.</abbr></strong> from North Eastern Hill University, Shillong.</em></p> 

<p>Born in Bhojkuchi, a remote village in Nalbari District of Assam, <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Barman has spent almost 28 years of his life as a teacher nurturing and educating his students to become lifelong learners. In this long term career, what he has experienced is that the role of the educators goes beyond transmitting knowledge — their role is to nurture their students to become lifelong learners — to teach them the skills of <em>how to learn</em> and to teach them <em>the appreciation</em> and <em>the love for knowledge</em>. His idea on teaching speaks about teaching as an exciting adventure in which both the teacher and the students participate and cooperate to achieve a common goal.</p>

<p>Apart from teaching, he is also a dynamic social activist with involvements with various academic and socio-cultural organizations and communities, whether regional and state level. He was <strong>Core Executive Committee Member</strong> of <strong>Assam College Teachers' Association</strong> or <strong><abbr>ACTA</abbr></strong>.</p>

<p>In the year of 2012, he was awarded the <strong>Vidya Ratan Award</strong> by the <strong>The Economic for Health &amp; Educational Growth, New Delhi</strong>, for his contributions to the society.</p>

<p>So far, <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Barman has authored <strong>Fluvio-Morphology and Settlements: A Case Study of Pagladiya-Morapagladiya River Catchment</strong>, a Book based on his studies and research, numerous Research paper, articles in journals and magazines. He is also a <strong>Recognized Research Guide</strong> in <strong>Geography</strong> by <strong>Vinayak Missions University, Salem, Tamilnadu.</strong></p>

<p>He is married with two sons and currently living in his private apartment along with his family in Tihu Town.</p>
